## Predicting patients with poor outcomes (hospital readmissions) from Medical Insurance Claims Data 

In this project, I am trying to predict patients with poor outcomes by using the frequency and duration of patient visit, their uasge of prescription drugs and other products & services. I do not have access to any medical information such as vitals, test results, scans or any other kind of diagnostic tests.


### Background
Overall 20% of the sickest patients consume 80% of the healthcare resources, be it cost or resource occupancy. Being able to predict the outcome (usually poor outcome) of a patient early-on can not only help in taking pre-emptive efforts to manage the condition but also help in managing the workload of the healthcare system thereby reducing cost and enhancing quality of life. 

### Can the insurer with only limited medical information such as disease diagnosis code, billing for the equipments, services and drugs used be able to predict the poor outcome of its clients. This project is an attempt to try this.
